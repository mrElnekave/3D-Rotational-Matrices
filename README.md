# 3D-Rotational-Matrices

This is my project for Mathematical Models in Linear Algebra, where I explore the use of 3D Matrices using my library, rubato.
Further explanation [here](/README.md#Description).

__To try it yourself, you can download and run the numerous exes or build it [yourself](/README.md#Installation), or go to [repl.it]() and run the big demo online.__

## Installation

1. Make a virtual environment \*If you want to:
   ![Venv](Usage-Demo/virtual_env.gif)

2. You must install rubato:
   ![Rubato](Usage-Demo/install_rubato.gif)

## big_demo

> Holds a runner.py file which showcases the 3 main creations.

![Run](Usage-Demo/runner.gif)

## general_python_rots

> Showcases how I came up w/ the algorithm as well as basic rotations and full control with WASD EQ of roll, pitch, yaw (in the gimbal_tutorial).

## C-rot

> all the original C commandline code. (Original project).

## Description

__If you want to see how it was done:__ 
* check these [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S6Tq5zvRbTNgvMFwpLw_Dwiy8rMKnze3SVTjfmKySYc/edit?usp=sharing) describing rotational matrices and gimbal locks.
* Or this YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/S26etodkbBY) on all the different elements and design process of this project.

 
Improvements:
* Repl.it demo.
* Linux C support
* Enhance the gimbal tutorial, adding colors to the different axes zero markers.
* Use matrix multiplication and possibly create a shader for the GPU, instead of pixel by pixel computation.
