# 3D-Rotational-Matrices

This is my project for Mathematical Models in Linear Algebra, where I explore the use of 3D Matrices using my library, rubato.
Further explanation [here](/#Description)

## Installation

1. Make a virtual environment \*If you want to:
   ![Venv](Usage-Demo/virtual_env.gif)

2. You must install rubato:

## big_demo

> Holds a runner.py file which showcases the 3 main creations.

![Run](Usage-Demo/runner.gif)

## general_python_rots

> Showcases how I came up w/ the algorithm as well as basic rotations and full control with WASD EQ of roll, pitch, yaw.

## base

> all the original C commandline code.
